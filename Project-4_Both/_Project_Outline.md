# Project Outline

When working on *requirements*, move them to *Pending Requirements* and, when done, move them all the way to the bottom under *Completed Requirements*.

## Notes

### Pre-Project

> "Authentication" pertains to "who I am" whereas "Authorization" pertains to "what I can do"

- Google OAuth will handle the *authentication* whereas the app. will handle *authorization*
- The application will, heavily, be Read-Only
- There are utilities that provide the "filters" and "pagination"
- For #5, under Claims (the long GET API)
  - Optional, however the claims end-point could be converted to a POST (from a GET) with an appended '/search' to hide the verbose URL
  - This entails passing the data through in the body and having a POJO that handles this
- Performance Nice-To-Have:
  - When working with data-requests where the output does not change much, you could consider caching data (for faster retrieval)
- You can use AI to generate the data (if desired)
  - Under #7, there is a mention of data
- Think of this project as there being another application that is handling the Claims creation… that application would be feeding the data that my app picks up
- The User entity is, primarily, intended for use with Google and OAuth
- To handle proper testing, provided YOUR Gmail account information and YOU will be the primary test-user
- There is **no** mention of a CSS framework

### Mid-Project

- The `Integer lineNumber` field, in `TSGClaimLine.java`, should auto-increment, however there is no required `POST` method so I have the SQL handling a form of a request to get the number when determining the next value
  - Per spec, it must be an integer-value, so this seems like a valid work-around

### Modifications

- Appended `TSG` to all Entity, Service, Controller and Repository names
  - I wanted to preserve the underlying name while avoiding any name-conflicts (e.g., *User*)
- `TSGPlan` - I appended `deductible` and `outOutPocketMax`
  - Base on other health insurance sites, this information is set/provided when searching for a plan and I figured that was a great starting-point (in real-world scenarios, I would expect it to change depending on the family size, however this example is one person)
- When building the *Entity* classes, I tweaked all instances of the following:
  - For *One-to-Many* relationships, they were added as *Many-to-One* and an appropriate Object-instance field was added, in all *children*, in lieu of the `UUID` foreign-keys
    - Based on research and, more specifically, the *High-Performance Java Persistence* book, a *Many-to-One* relationship is more performant than the *One-to-Many* not to mention it is best practice to use an Object-instance foreign key **not** a standard `UUID`
      - Apparently the Object-instance foreign keys boil down to a `UUID` under the hood
- Changed table-name of `User` to `TSGUser` because PostgreSQL "User" is a reserved word in PostgreSQL



## General Information

**Name:** Member Benefit Dashboard

**Core tech stack:** React (frontend), Java + Spring Boot (backend), Postgres (database)  
**Authentication:** **Federated via OIDC** (e.g., **Google**) or another preferred IDP (Okta/Auth0/Azure AD). The app **does not manage passwords**; authentication is delegated to the IDP.

> **Goal:** Build a focused member portal with exactly **four screens**: **Login (Federated)**, **Dashboard**, **Claims List**, and **Claim Detail**.  
> Emphasis on clean data modeling, REST APIs, server‑side filtering/pagination, and a clear UI. Keep the code production‑style but right‑sized for a two‑week effort.

### 1) Domain Background (Healthcare Claims 101 — Short Primer)

#### Core Concepts

- **Member:** Person enrolled in a health plan. May have dependents (out of scope for core).
- **Provider:** Clinic or clinician who renders care.
- **Plan:** The product the member is enrolled in (e.g., PPO/HMO) with cost‑share rules.
- **Claim:** A bill submitted by a provider; contains one or more **Claim Lines** (procedures/services).
- **EOB (Explanation of Benefits):** Statement explaining how the claim was adjudicated.
- **Accumulators:** Running totals of a member’s financial responsibility against plan limits (e.g., **Deductible** and **Out‑of‑Pocket Maximum**).

#### Simplified Processing Flow

1. Member receives care → provider submits claim.  
2. Claim is **adjudicated** against plan rules: allowed amount is calculated; cost shares (copay, coinsurance, deductible) are applied.  
3. Claim reaches a status (e.g., **Submitted → In Review → Processed → Paid/Denied**).  
4. Member responsibility and accumulators update; an EOB may be generated.

#### Why build a new dashboard?

**Legacy pain** (what the hypothetical client has today):
- Fragmented systems → inconsistent totals between pages.
- No robust filtering or sorting → members cannot find specific visits.
- Non‑responsive UI with accessibility gaps.
- Batched PDFs only (EOB) and little inline explanation of totals.

**New approach** (what you’ll build):
- Unified domain model (claims, lines, accumulators, provider, plan) serviced by simple REST APIs.
- Fast, filterable **Claims List** with server‑side pagination.
- Clear **Dashboard** with accumulator progress + recent claims.
- Modern, responsive UI with basic accessibility and proper error handling.
- **Federated auth (OIDC)** to offload identity & session security to a trusted provider.

### 2) Application Scope (Exactly 4 Screens)

- **S1:** Login (**Federated/OIDC**)  
- **S2:** Dashboard  
- **S3:** Claims List  
- **S4:** Claim Detail  

> **Global UI (not a separate screen):** App header with product name, member name, and **Sign out**; a simple top nav or breadcrumb to reach **Dashboard** and **Claims**.

### 3) Screen Specifications (User Story, Acceptance Criteria, ASCII Mockup)

#### S1) Login (Federated/OIDC)

**User Story**  
As a member, I want to sign in with my organization/Google account so only I can view my claims.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The login view provides a **“Continue with Google”** (or chosen IDP) action that starts the **OIDC Authorization Code Flow** (no email/password fields rendered by the app).  
- AC2: On successful IDP callback, the app stores the session/token and routes the user to **Dashboard**.  
- AC3: On authentication error, show a non‑blocking inline message and allow retry.
  - **Disregard:** Google should handle any error message so this is no longer necessary.

> You should be able to pass Google a redirectUrl that the user is sent to after successful login. It's fine if that is default landing page. But if you all dare to try, if a user tries to go directly to one of the other pages in the app, then is redirected to login page, it should send the URL the user was sent from as the redirectUrl. This will redirect the user back to where they tried to go after logging in. -- Mitch

- AC4: Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the **OIDC sign‑in**.  
- AC5: **Sign out** clears tokens and, if supported, calls the IDP **end‑session** endpoint, then returns to the login view.

### 4) Data Model (Define as Java Classes)

> Implement with JPA/Hibernate (or similar). Monetary amounts as `BigDecimal`. Dates as `LocalDate`; timestamps as `OffsetDateTime`/`Instant`. Keep it minimal but complete for the 4 screens.

#### Enums

```java
public enum ClaimStatus { SUBMITTED, IN_REVIEW, PROCESSED, PAID, DENIED }
public enum AccumulatorType { DEDUCTIBLE, OOP_MAX }
public enum NetworkTier { IN_NETWORK, OUT_OF_NETWORK }
public enum PlanType { HMO, PPO, EPO, HDHP }
```

#### Core Entities

**User** (updated for federated auth; no password storage)
```java
class User {
  UUID id;
  String authProvider;     // e.g., "google", "okta"
  String authSub;          // OIDC subject ("sub"), unique per provider
  String email;            // from ID token
  OffsetDateTime createdAt;
  OffsetDateTime updatedAt;
}
```

**Member**
```java
class Member {
  UUID id;
  UUID userId;           // FK -> User
  String firstName;
  String lastName;
  LocalDate dateOfBirth;
  String email;          // optional profile display
  String phone;          // optional profile display
  Address mailingAddress; // optional embedded/owned
  List<Enrollment> enrollments; // one active for current plan year
}

/*
NOTE: Spring, by default, will prepend the name of the Address variable to 
... all variable names in the Address class (e.g., mailingAddress_line1)
*/
```


**Address (Embeddable)**
```java
class Address {
  String line1;
  String line2;
  String city;
  String state;
  String postalCode;
}
```


**Plan**
```java
class Plan {
  UUID id;
  String name;         // e.g., "Gold PPO"
  PlanType type;       // PPO/HMO/...
  String networkName;  // e.g., "Prime"
  Integer planYear;    // e.g., 2025
}
```

**Enrollment**
```java
class Enrollment {
  UUID id;
  UUID memberId;
  UUID planId;
  LocalDate coverageStart;
  LocalDate coverageEnd;
  Boolean active;
  List<Accumulator> accumulators;
}
```

**Accumulator**
```java
class Accumulator {
  UUID id;
  UUID enrollmentId;
  AccumulatorType type;       // DEDUCTIBLE or OOP_MAX
  NetworkTier tier;           // IN_NETWORK/OUT_OF_NETWORK
  BigDecimal limitAmount;     // e.g., 1500.00
  BigDecimal usedAmount;      // e.g., 300.00
}
```

**Provider**
```java
class Provider {
  UUID id;
  String name;
  String specialty;
  Address address;
  String phone;
}
```

**Claim**
```java
class Claim {
  UUID id;
  String claimNumber;         // human-friendly key for UI
  UUID memberId;
  UUID providerId;
  LocalDate serviceStartDate;
  LocalDate serviceEndDate;
  LocalDate receivedDate;
  ClaimStatus status;
  BigDecimal totalBilled;
  BigDecimal totalAllowed;
  BigDecimal totalPlanPaid;
  BigDecimal totalMemberResponsibility;
  List<ClaimLine> lines;
  List<ClaimStatusEvent> statusHistory;
  OffsetDateTime updatedAt;
}
```

**ClaimLine**
```java
class ClaimLine {
  UUID id;
  UUID claimId;
  Integer lineNumber;         // 1..n
  String cptCode;             // e.g., "99213"
  String description;
  BigDecimal billedAmount;
  BigDecimal allowedAmount;
  BigDecimal deductibleApplied;
  BigDecimal copayApplied;
  BigDecimal coinsuranceApplied;
  BigDecimal planPaid;
  BigDecimal memberResponsibility;
}
```

**ClaimStatusEvent**
```java
class ClaimStatusEvent {
  UUID id;
  UUID claimId;
  ClaimStatus status;
  OffsetDateTime occurredAt;
  String note;                // optional
}
```

*(Stretch model — optional)*
```java
class Document {
  UUID id;
  String fileName;
  String mimeType;     // "application/pdf"
  String storagePath;  // e.g., "/static/eobs/C-10421.pdf"
  UUID memberId;
  UUID claimId;        // for EOB, nullable otherwise
  OffsetDateTime uploadedAt;
}
```

### 5) Minimal API Surface (Guidance)

> Keep payloads small and tailored to the screens. Use pagination on list endpoints.

- **Auth (Federated/OIDC)**
  - **No local login/logout endpoints.** Frontend initiates OIDC; backend is an **OAuth2 Resource Server** validating JWT access tokens (issuer, audience, JWKs).  
  - `GET /api/auth/me` → current user + member basic info (derived from token + DB mapping).

- **Dashboard**
  - `GET /api/dashboard` → active plan, accumulators (in‑network), recent claims (5)

- **Claims**
  - `GET /api/claims?status=&startDate=&endDate=&provider=&claimNumber=&page=&size=`
  - `GET /api/claims/{claimNumber}` → detail with lines + statusHistory
  - *(Stretch)* `GET /api/claims/{claimNumber}/eob` → PDF

### 6) Nice‑to‑Haves / Stretch Goals

- **Automated Tests**
  - Backend: JUnit + Spring Test for services/controllers/repos.
  - Frontend: React Testing Library for table filtering, routing, and detail view.

- **Dockerization**
  - Containerize **frontend**, **backend**, and **postgres**; provide `docker-compose.yml` for local run.

- **GraphQL Endpoint**
  - Add GraphQL with queries like `member(id)`, `claims(...)`, and `claim(claimNumber)`.
  - Swap **Dashboard** and **Claim Detail** data fetches to GraphQL while keeping REST for auth.

- **Performance & UX**
  - HTTP caching headers on read endpoints; skeleton loaders; optimistic UI for minor updates (if any).

- **Accessibility**
  - Keyboard navigation, focus management on route change, aria‑labels and error associations.

- **Observability**
  - Health endpoint, basic request logging, correlation IDs.

### 7) Non‑Functional Expectations

- Clean layering (controller → service → repo), DTOs for API payloads.
- Seed script/migration for: one user/member (mapped by `authSub`), one plan/enrollment, accumulators, 8–15 claims (with lines), 2–3 providers.
- Pagination defaults: size **10**, max **25**.
- Time zones: store UTC; present in user’s local in UI.
- Formatting: currency two decimals; dates `MM/DD/YYYY`.

### 8) Deliverables

- **README** with setup/run instructions and **OIDC configuration** (issuer URL, client ID, redirect URI), plus directions for using Google or an alternative IDP.  
- **Frontend (React)** with the 4 screens above and routing.  
- **Backend (Spring Boot)** with minimal REST (and optional GraphQL).  
- **Postgres** schema via ORM/migrations; migration files checked in.  
- *(Optional)* Docker Compose to run everything locally.  
- Tests and/or screenshots of passing tests where implemented.

### 9) Acceptance Test Ideas (Spot‑Checks)

- **Sign in via IDP (e.g., Google)** → app lands on Dashboard; refresh preserves session.  
- Dashboard shows the expected accumulators and top 5 recent claims.  
- Claims List filter by **Status=Processed** + date range returns expected rows; pagination works.  
- Claim Detail totals equal the sum of line items; status timeline shows ordered history.  
- *(Stretch)* EOB download returns a PDF for that claim.  
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to IDP sign‑in from protected routes.

**End of 4‑Screen Spec (Federated Auth)**
