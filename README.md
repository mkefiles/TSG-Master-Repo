### Project 1
This is a *backend* REST API project with made using Javalin. See Project Overview for project-specific information.

### Project 2
This is a *backend* REST API project with Spring. It is similar to Project 1, however it uses the Spring Framework to accomplish the tasks. See Project Overview for project-specific information.

### Project 3
This is a *full-stack* project that uses Spring for a *backend* REST API, React for the *frontend* and PostgreSQL for the *database*. The project is **incomplete** as I was unable to finish all requirements within the alotted time-frame. The *backend* is almost complete, however the *frontend* was not started whatsoever. See Project Overview for project-specific information.

### Project 4
This is another *full-stack* project that uses Spring for a *backend* REST API, React for the *frontend* and PostgreSQL for the *database*. The project is **incomplete** as I was unable to finish all requirements within the alotted time-frame. The *backend* endpoints are complete and the *frontend* is partially complete. See Project Overview for project-specific information.

### Project 5
This project consists of two separate, yet simple, React projects that were created after following the React tutorial (linked below). Note that there is no Project Overview for this.

### Project 6
This is a **basic** RabbitMQ project (using regular Java). The goal was to gain a basic understanding of RabbitMQ and to test that my Docker instance of RabbitMQ was working as anticipated.

### Project 7
This is a **basic** RabbitMQ project that pulls in Spring. At this point, I was aiming to try and deploy a simple Spring application with RabbitMQ.

### Project 8
This is a *backend* project that uses Spring (and Spring Modulith) as well as RabbitMQ. This challenge also uses some basic Unit Tests with Mockito and JUnit. See Project Overview for project-specific information.
