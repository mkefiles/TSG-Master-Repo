# Note to Mike

Use the directories and files within this directory as a base-point for an empty Vite-React project that uses TypeScript.

Once an example has been completed, you could copy those files into their own directory then restore the project back-to-basics while using the same *node_modules*.

Just make sure **not** to delete this in any way otherwise you won't have a base-point.
